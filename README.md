# FileUploaderDemo

A simple file-uploader using node/express with mime type validation. Frontend uses Angular 16 and TailwindCSS.

1. npm install

2. npm run start-all 
This will start the frontend and backend together using concurrently.

If you start them separately, start the backend from the root folder so that the uploads path is correct.
npx nodemon backend/app.js
